Project Name
Overview
This project was developed as part of a technical test for a Flutter developer role at Pavlok, a company known for its innovative behavior-changing devices.

Project Story
The journey of this project began when a Flutter developer role opened up at Pavlok. A friend of mine, aware of my skills and experience, recommended me for the position. I promptly sent in my CV and portfolio, and was thrilled to be accepted in the initial phase.

Technical Challenge
The main challenge was to develop an application that communicates with a device through an API service. The application needed to send stimuli to the device, which would then trigger specific reactions. Additionally, I was tasked with designing a user-friendly interface to ensure a smooth and engaging user experience.

Key Features
API Integration: The application communicates with the device using an API service to send stimuli.
Real-Time Responses: Stimuli trigger specific reactions on the device in real-time.
User Interface Design: A visually appealing and intuitive layout was designed to enhance user experience.
Backend Services: Implemented and integrated backend services to support application functionality.
Technologies Used
Flutter: For developing the cross-platform application.
API Services: For communication between the app and the device.
UI/UX Design: Tools and principles used to design the application interface.
