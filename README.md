Project Story : \n
This project began when a Flutter developer role opened at Pavlok, known for its behavior-changing devices. A friend recommended me, and after submitting my CV and portfolio, I was accepted into the initial phase.

The technical test required developing an application that sends stimuli to a device via an API service, triggering specific reactions. I also designed the user interface to ensure a smooth and engaging user experience.

This project highlights my skills in Flutter development, backend integration, API communication, and UI design. Through this test, I demonstrated my ability to work on innovative and impactful projects.
